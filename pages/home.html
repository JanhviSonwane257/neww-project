        <p>Vada Pav is an iconic Mumbai street food consisting of a deep-fried, spiced potato fritter (vada) nestled inside a soft bread bun (pav), often accompanied by chutneys and green chili. Invented around the 1960s by Ashok Vaidya, it serves as an affordable, staple snack for commuters and workers, often referred to as an "Indian burger". </p><br/>

    <p>Momos are popular Tibetan and Nepali dumplings made from refined flour dough, traditionally stuffed with minced meat (like yak or chicken), vegetables, or cheese, then steamed, fried, or pan-fried. Originating in Tibet, they became a staple, beloved street food across India, particularly in the Northeast, and are typically served with spicy red chili-garlic chutney.</p>

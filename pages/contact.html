    <p>Biryani is a popular South Asian rice dish made with spiced marinated meat (chicken, goat, beef), fish, or vegetables, layered with aromatic basmati rice. Originating from Persian "fried rice" traditions brought to India, it is characterized by saffron, fragrant spices, and slow-cooking, making it a beloved comfort food. </p><br/>
